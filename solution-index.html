			<p>Hello! My name is Kristina Lyons and I am absolutely thrilled to be embarking on a new path as a web developer! Currently, I am a financial services professional in Lake Mary, Florida while presently attending a coding boot camp to kickstart my career. Although born and raised in New York City, I have called Florida my home for many, many years. I am a terrific daughter, super sister, amazing auntie, crazy dope girlfriend, and loving friend.</p>
				<p>In my spare time, I watch a little too much television and an occasional movie. I like crime and mystery shows, mob movies, reality tv and comedies. I enjoy traveling, particularly to warm, tropical climates. I have a keen interest in interior design and decor, logic puzzles, and dabble in cooking and baking when the mood strikes me. Family and friends are truly the most valuable things to me. Material things are great too, but not if you can't enjoy them with the people you love. I believe we learn from our mistakes and failures in life, much more than our successes. A new day brings yet another opportunity to be greater than you were the day before.</p>
